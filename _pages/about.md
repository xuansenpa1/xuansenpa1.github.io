Hi, I am Yuxuan Liu (刘宇轩), a PhD student supervised by Prof. Yangqiu Song at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence at Harbin Institute of Technology. I was fortunate to intern at Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR) under the guidance of Prof. Wanxiang Che.
